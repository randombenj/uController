#How to: assembly

This is a tutorial to learn the (AVR-)Assembly language. This tutorial focuses on how to build assembly 
instructions based on higher languages like c/c++ etc. 
!The tutorial is entirely based on my assembly experience and stuff from the interwebs.
Ideas for improvment are welcome. :D
