# LCD Timer Menu

The LCD Timer Menu contains 8 timers which activate pins on a port. A timer has a
start and an end time (HH:MM). If the start time matches the end time, the timer
has to be turned off manualy (by holding enter). Additionaly to the start and
end time of the timer, the weekdays on which it will be triggered can be set.
